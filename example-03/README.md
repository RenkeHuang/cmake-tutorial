CMake is not just for C/C++, it can be used also for Fortran projects. In this
example we will build a C++/Fortran project. We will also get acquainted with
CTest, the testing framework that is part of the CMake suite.
The exercise is based on [this CodeRefinery lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/cmake/07-exercise/).

Fork [this project](https://github.com/bast/calculator) and clone it.
